Stop Paying for Hosting. Start Managing Money Smarter.
Budget Tracker Pro is a modern, lightweight, and completely serverless Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for personal finance management. Unlike traditional scripts that require expensive PHP hosting and MySQL databases, Budget Tracker Pro runs entirely on Google Firebase (Free Tier), meaning zero monthly server costs for you or your users.

It comes pre-configured with Indian Numbering Logic (₹ Lakhs/Crores), making it the perfect solution for the South Asian market, or easily customizable for global currencies.
